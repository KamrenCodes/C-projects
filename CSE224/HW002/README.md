Hey Nick,

My name is Kamren. I'm working towards my AST2 for computer science. As for experience, I did a udemy course for python that was done in powershell. From there, I am also doing a Google IT cert on coursera which has a section about becoming a power user and covers linux, mac, windows etc. 

I hope you have a good quarter, thanks!
