High-Low - The player vs computer number guessing game - Can the computer guess your number?

High-Low is a guessing game where the computer goes against the player and tries to guess their number within a reasonable amount of guesses. 

//----------------------------------------------
The rules are simple:

NO CHEATING
1. Press "h" if the guess is too high
2. Press "l" if the guess is too low
3. Press "c" if the guess is correct

//----------------------------------------------

The game will auto default to asking you to think of a number between 1-100; however, if you'd like to widen the range you can do so by including a legal positive integer at the command line between 1 and whatever number higher then 100 you'd like to use. Ex: highlow 500
