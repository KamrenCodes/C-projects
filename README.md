# C-projects
This section will be an accumulation of all my school assignments done in C, C++, Bash, and some Java.

**Decimal to Binary:**

    An implementation of a program that will take any number 0 to 2^64 and give you the binary representation in C.

**Palindrome Check:**

    An implementation of a program that will check to see if the word is a palindrome in C.

**CSE222 includes:**

    **PA1** -> An implementation of an alphabetically sorted linked list using chaining in C.
    
    **PA2**-> An implementation of a hash table in C.
    
    **PA3**-> An implementation of a binary search tree in C.
    
    **PA4**-> An implementation of a solution for the knapsack problem using dynamic programming in C.


**CSE223 includes:**

    **PA1** -> An implementation of a class that prints "Hello World!" in Java.
    
    **PA2**-> An implementation of a main class that does addition, multiplication of numbers given as a command line argument in Java.
    
    **PA3** -> An implementation of a main and vector class that performs vector addition, subtraction, multiplication, computes length, computes the normalized vector in Java.
    
    **PA4** -> An implementation of a dual hashmap program using generics that reads from a data.txt and saves key/value pairs to identify students, their sids, and the classes they enrolled in, in Java.
    
    **PA5** -> An implementation of a dots game with an implemented GUI using swing in Java.
    
    **PA6** -> An implementation of the dots game using network threading in Java.


**CSE224 includes:**

    **PA1** -> An implementation of a stick game in C.
    
    **PA2** -> An implementation of a program that counts how many words something appears from a file "keywords.txt" in C.
    
    **PA3** -> A re-implementation of the stick game in Bash.
    
    **PA4** -> An implmentation of a High/Low guessing game that demonstrates a divide and conquerer algo that can detect cheating in C.
    
    **PA5** -> An implmentation of a personal calendar using a GUI in Bash.

**C867 Includes:**

    **Class Roster Project** -> An implementation of taking in an array of student information as strings, parsing said strings, and creating mutliple student objects that are stored in a roster array in C++
